## `deleteAccount()`

```php
deleteAccount($id, $x_http_method_override, $x_request_id)
```

Delete an account

Delete a single bank account of the user that is authorized by the access_token, including its transactions and balance data. Must pass the account's identifier and the user's access_token.<br/><br/>Notes: <br/>- You cannot delete an account while the bank connection that it relates to is currently in the process of import, update, or transaction categorization. <br/>- When the last remaining account of a bank connection gets deleted, then the bank connection itself will get deleted as well! <br/>- All notification rules that are connected to the account will get adjusted so that they no longer have this account listed. Notification rules that are connected to just this account (and no other accounts) will get deleted altogether.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: finapi_auth
$config = OpenAPIAccess\Client\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');

// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: finapi_auth
$config = OpenAPIAccess\Client\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');


$apiInstance = new OpenAPIAccess\Client\Api\AccountsApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$id = 56; // int | Identifier of the account to delete
$x_http_method_override = 'x_http_method_override_example'; // string | Some HTTP clients do not support the HTTP methods PATCH or DELETE. If you are using such a client in your application, you can use a POST request instead with this header indicating the originally intended HTTP method. POST Requests having this  header set will be treated either as PATCH or DELETE by the finAPI servers.
$x_request_id = 'x_request_id_example'; // string | With any API call, you can pass a request ID. The request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters. Passing a longer string will result in an error. If you don't pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally. The request ID is always returned back in the response of a service, as a header with name 'X-Request-Id'. We highly recommend to always pass a (preferably unique) request ID, and include it into your client application logs whenever you make a request or receive a response (especially in the case of an error response). finAPI is also logging request IDs on its end. Having a request ID can help the finAPI support team to work more efficiently and solve tickets faster.

try {
    $apiInstance->deleteAccount($id, $x_http_method_override, $x_request_id);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling AccountsApi->deleteAccount: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
```

## `getDailyBalances()`

```php
getDailyBalances($account_ids, $start_date, $end_date, $with_projection, $page, $per_page, $order, $x_request_id): \OpenAPIAccess\Client\Model\DailyBalanceList
```

Get daily balances

Returns the user's daily balances for a given period and a set of specified accounts (or all accounts, if none are specified). The daily balances are calculated by finAPI and are based on the current balances of the regarded accounts.<br/><br/>NOTE: This service is not calculating exchange rates for transactions, so if an account contains any transactions with a currency different to the account's currency, then the service is unable to provide accurate data.

### Example

    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$account_ids = array(56); // int[] | A comma-separated list of (non-security) account identifiers. If no accounts are specified, all (non-security) accounts of the user are regarded.
$start_date = 'start_date_example'; // string | A string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. Note that the requested date range [startDate..endDate] may not exceed 1 year (366 days - considering Leap Years too).If startDate is not specified, it defaults to the endDate minus one month.
$end_date = 'end_date_example'; // string | A string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. Note that the requested date range [startDate..endDate] may not exceed 1 year (366 days - considering Leap Years too). If endDate is not specified, it defaults to today's date.
$with_projection = true; // bool | Whether finAPI should project the first and last actually existing balance of an account into the past and future. When passing 'true', then the result will always contain a daily balance for every day of the entire requested date range, even for days before the first actually existing balance, resp. after the last actually existing balance. Those days will have the same balance as the day of the first actual balance, resp. last actual balance, i.e. the first/last balance will be infinitely projected into the past/the future. When passing 'false', then the result will contain daily balances only from the day on where the first actual balance exists for any of the regarded accounts, and only up to the day where the last actual balance exists for any of the regarded accounts. Note that when in this case there are no actual balances within the requested date range, then an empty array will be returned. Default value for this parameter is 'true'.
$page = 1; // int | Result page that you want to retrieve.
$per_page = 20; // int | Maximum number of records per page. By default it's 20. Can be at most 500.
$order = array('order_example'); // string[] | Determines the order of the results. You can order the results by 'date', 'balance', 'income' or 'spending'. The default order for this service is 'date,asc'. You can also order by multiple properties. In that case the order of the parameters passed is important. Example: '/accounts/dailyBalances?order=date,desc&order=balance,asc' will return daily balances ordered by 'date' (descending), where items with the same 'date' are ordered by 'balance' (ascending). The general format is: 'property[,asc|desc]', with 'asc' being the default value.
$x_request_id = 'x_request_id_example'; // string | With any API call, you can pass a request ID. The request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters. Passing a longer string will result in an error. If you don't pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally. The request ID is always returned back in the response of a service, as a header with name 'X-Request-Id'. We highly recommend to always pass a (preferably unique) request ID, and include it into your client application logs whenever you make a request or receive a response (especially in the case of an error response). finAPI is also logging request IDs on its end. Having a request ID can help the finAPI support team to work more efficiently and solve tickets faster.

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **account_ids** | [**int[]**](../Model/int.md)| A comma-separated list of (non-security) account identifiers. If no accounts are specified, all (non-security) accounts of the user are regarded. | [optional]
 **start_date** | **string**| A string in the format &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;. Note that the requested date range [startDate..endDate] may not exceed 1 year (366 days - considering Leap Years too).If startDate is not specified, it defaults to the endDate minus one month. | [optional]
 **end_date** | **string**| A string in the format &#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;. Note that the requested date range [startDate..endDate] may not exceed 1 year (366 days - considering Leap Years too). If endDate is not specified, it defaults to today&#39;s date. | [optional]
 **with_projection** | **bool**| Whether finAPI should project the first and last actually existing balance of an account into the past and future. When passing &#39;true&#39;, then the result will always contain a daily balance for every day of the entire requested date range, even for days before the first actually existing balance, resp. after the last actually existing balance. Those days will have the same balance as the day of the first actual balance, resp. last actual balance, i.e. the first/last balance will be infinitely projected into the past/the future. When passing &#39;false&#39;, then the result will contain daily balances only from the day on where the first actual balance exists for any of the regarded accounts, and only up to the day where the last actual balance exists for any of the regarded accounts. Note that when in this case there are no actual balances within the requested date range, then an empty array will be returned. Default value for this parameter is &#39;true&#39;. | [optional] [default to true]
 **page** | **int**| Result page that you want to retrieve. | [optional] [default to 1]
 **per_page** | **int**| Maximum number of records per page. By default it&#39;s 20. Can be at most 500. | [optional] [default to 20]
 **order** | [**string[]**](../Model/string.md)| Determines the order of the results. You can order the results by &#39;date&#39;, &#39;balance&#39;, &#39;income&#39; or &#39;spending&#39;. The default order for this service is &#39;date,asc&#39;. You can also order by multiple properties. In that case the order of the parameters passed is important. Example: &#39;/accounts/dailyBalances?order&#x3D;date,desc&amp;order&#x3D;balance,asc&#39; will return daily balances ordered by &#39;date&#39; (descending), where items with the same &#39;date&#39; are ordered by &#39;balance&#39; (ascending). The general format is: &#39;property[,asc|desc]&#39;, with &#39;asc&#39; being the default value. | [optional]
 **x_request_id** | **string**| With any API call, you can pass a request ID. The request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters. Passing a longer string will result in an error. If you don&#39;t pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally. The request ID is always returned back in the response of a service, as a header with name &#39;X-Request-Id&#39;. We highly recommend to always pass a (preferably unique) request ID, and include it into your client application logs whenever you make a request or receive a response (especially in the case of an error response). finAPI is also logging request IDs on its end. Having a request ID can help the finAPI support team to work more efficiently and solve tickets faster. | [optional]
