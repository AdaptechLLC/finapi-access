## `connectInterface()`

```php
connectInterface($connect_interface_params, $psu_ip_address, $psu_device_os, $psu_user_agent, $x_request_id): \OpenAPIAccess\Client\Model\BankConnection
```

Connect a new interface

If you are unlicensed, or licensed but using finAPIâ€™s Web Form, this endpoint is not relevant to you. Instead, please refer to the endpoint <a href='https://docs.finapi.io?product=web_form_2.0#post-/api/tasks/backgroundUpdate' target='_blank'>here</a>.<br/><br/>Connects a new interface to an existing bank connection for a specific user. Must pass the connection credentials and the user's access_token. All bank accounts will be downloaded and imported with their current balances, transactions and supported two-step-procedures (note that the amount of available transactions may vary between banks, e.g. some banks deliver all transactions from the past year, others only deliver the transactions from the past three months). The balance and transactions download process runs asynchronously, so this service may return before all balances and transactions have been imported. Also, all downloaded transactions will be categorized by a separate background process that runs asynchronously too. To check the status of the balance and transactions download process as well as the background categorization process, see the status flags that are returned by the GET /bankConnections/&lt;id&gt; service.<br/><br/>NOTE (THIS LOGIC IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED):<br/>Depending on your license, this service may respond with HTTP code 451, containing an error message with an identifier of Web Form in it. In addition to that the response will also have included a 'Location' header, which contains the URL to the Web Form. In this case, you must forward your user to finAPI's Web Form.<br/><br/><b>ATTENTION:</b><ul><li>For XS2A interface additional headers must be included in the request if the end user is involved. Please refer to the <a href='#general-user-metadata'>User metadata</a> section under 'General Information' of the API documentation.</li><li>Due to bank-side changes we have been forced to limit the transactions download range to 89 days, to reduce the risk of strong customer authentication (SCA) requests.<br/>If you have implemented the SCA flow, please contact us, so that we can remove this limitation from your client.</li></ul>

$x_request_id = 'x_request_id_example'; // string | With any API call, you can pass a request ID. The request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters. Passing a longer string will result in an error. If you don't pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally. The request ID is always returned back in the response of a service, as a header with name 'X-Request-Id'. We highly recommend to always pass a (preferably unique) request ID, and include it into your client application logs whenever you make a request or receive a response (especially in the case of an error response). finAPI is also logging request IDs on its end. Having a request ID can help the finAPI support team to work more efficiently and solve tickets faster.

Get all bank connections

Get bank connections of the user that is authorized by the access_token. Must pass the user's access_token. You can set optional search criteria to get only those bank connections that you are interested in. If you do not specify any search criteria, then this service functions as a 'get all' service.<br/>Web Form 2.0 customers should also use this endpoint to learn about the status of the bank connection (The bank connection ID can be found in the payload of the API response from the relevant Web Form 2.0 API endpoint).

## `getBankConnection()`

```php
getBankConnection($id, $x_request_id): \OpenAPIAccess\Client\Model\BankConnection
```

Get a bank connection

Get a single bank connection of the user that is authorized by the access_token. Must pass the connection's identifier and the user's access_token.<br/>Web Form 2.0 customers should also use this endpoint to learn about the status of the bank connection (The bank connection ID can be found in the payload of the API response from the relevant Web Form 2.0 API endpoint).

### Example

```php
<?php

## `importBankConnection()`

```php
importBankConnection($import_bank_connection_params, $psu_ip_address, $psu_device_os, $psu_user_agent, $x_request_id): \OpenAPIAccess\Client\Model\BankConnection
```

Import a new bank connection

If you are unlicensed, or licensed but using finAPIâ€™s Web Form, this endpoint is not relevant to you. Instead, please refer to the endpoint <a href='https://docs.finapi.io?product=web_form_2.0#post-/api/webForms/bankConnectionImport' target='_blank'>here</a>.<br/><br/>Imports a new bank connection for a specific user. Must pass the connection credentials and the user's access_token. All bank accounts will be downloaded and imported with their current balances, transactions and supported two-step-procedures (note that the amount of available transactions may vary between banks, e.g. some banks deliver all transactions from the past year, others only deliver the transactions from the past three months). The balance and transactions download process runs asynchronously, so this service may return before all balances and transactions have been imported. Also, all downloaded transactions will be categorized by a separate background process that runs asynchronously too. To check the status of the balance and transactions download process as well as the background categorization process, see the status flags that are returned by the GET /bankConnections/&lt;id&gt; service.<br/><br/>To test the API, you can import a \"demo connection\". To import the demo connection, you need to pass the identifier of the \"finAPI Test Bank\". For more details, please see the associated <a href='https://documentation.finapi.io/access/finAPI-Test-Banks.2556264541.html' target='_blank'>documentation</a>.<br/><br/>For a more in-depth understanding of the import process, please also read this page on our Access Public Documentation: <a href='https://documentation.finapi.io/access/Post-Processing-of-Bank-Account-Import%2FUpdate.2766405656.html' target='_blank'>Post Processing of Bank Account Import/Update</a><br/><br/><b>ATTENTION:</b><ul><li>For XS2A interface additional headers must be included in the request if the end user is involved. Please refer to the <a href='#general-user-metadata'>User metadata</a> section under 'General Information' of the API documentation.</li><li>Due to bank-side changes we have been forced to limit the transactions download range to 89 days, to reduce the risk of strong customer authentication (SCA) requests.<br/>If you have implemented the SCA flow, please contact us, so that we can remove this limitation from your client.</li></ul>

Downloads and imports the current account balances and new transactions. Note that if the bank connection has several interfaces and some of its accounts was previously imported or updated via an interface which have higher priority than the interface used in the current update, then balances and transactions will not be downloaded for such accounts (The XS2A interface has the highest priority, followed by FINTS_SERVER and finally WEB_SCRAPER). Must pass the connection's identifier and the user's access_token. For more information about the processes of authentication, data download and transaction categorization, see POST /bankConnections/import. Note that supported two-step-procedures are updated as well. It may unset the current default two-step-procedure of the given bank connection (but only if this procedure is not supported anymore by the bank). You can also update the \"demo connection\" (in this case, secret login credentials and the fields 'importNewAccounts' and 'skipPositionsDownload' will be ignored).<br/><br/>Note that you cannot trigger an update of a bank connection as long as there is still a previously triggered update running.<br/><br/>For a more in-depth understanding of the update process, please also read this page on our Access Public Documentation: <a href='https://documentation.finapi.io/access/Post-Processing-of-Bank-Account-Import%2FUpdate.2766405656.html' target='_blank'>Post Processing of Bank Account Import/Update</a><br/><br/>NOTE (THIS LOGIC IS DEPRECATED AND WILL BE REMOVED):<br/>Depending on your license, this service may respond with HTTP code 451, containing an error message with an identifier of Web Form in it.
