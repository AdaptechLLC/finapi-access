<strong>Caution</strong>! This end point is applicable only for customers using the old Web Form. Web Form 2.0 customers must navigate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.finapi.io?product=web_form_2.0#tag--Web-forms\">here</a> for the same functionality.<br/><br/>Get a web form of the user that is authorized by the access_token. Must pass the web form's identifier and the user's access_token. <br/><br/>Note that every web form resource is automatically removed from the finAPI system after 7 days from its creation.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: finapi_auth
$config = OpenAPIAccess\Client\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');

// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: finapi_auth
$config = OpenAPIAccess\Client\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');


$apiInstance = new OpenAPIAccess\Client\Api\WebFormsApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$id = 56; // int | Identifier of web form
$x_request_id = 'x_request_id_example'; // string | With any API call, you can pass a request ID. The request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters. Passing a longer string will result in an error. If you don't pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally. The request ID is always returned back in the response of a service, as a header with name 'X-Request-Id'. We highly recommend to always pass a (preferably unique) request ID, and include it into your client application logs whenever you make a request or receive a response (especially in the case of an error response). finAPI is also logging request IDs on its end. Having a request ID can help the finAPI support team to work more efficiently and solve tickets faster.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->getWebForm($id, $x_request_id);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling WebFormsApi->getWebForm: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
```
