## `createUser()`

```php
createUser($user_create_params, $x_request_id): \OpenAPIAccess\Client\Model\User
```

Create a new user

<p>Create a new user. Must pass your global (i.e. client) access_token. </p><p>This service returns the user's password as plain text. </p><p>The automatic update of the user's bank connections is disabled by default for any new user. User identifiers are regarded case-insensitive by finAPI.</p><p>Please note that finAPI generally has a restricted set of allowed characters for input fields. You can find the allowed characters <a href = \"https://finapi.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/222013148-What-symbols-are-allowed-in-finAPI-\">here</a>. If a field does not explicitly specify a set of allowed characters, then these are the characters that are allowed for the field. Some fields may specify a different set of characters, in which case this will be documented for the field (like for the 'id' field in this service).</p>

### Example

```php

require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: finapi_auth
$config = OpenAPIAccess\Client\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');

    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$user_create_params = new \OpenAPIAccess\Client\Model\UserCreateParams(); // \OpenAPIAccess\Client\Model\UserCreateParams | User's details
$x_request_id = 'x_request_id_example'; // string | With any API call, you can pass a request ID. The request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters. Passing a longer string will result in an error. If you don't pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally. The request ID is always returned back in the response of a service, as a header with name 'X-Request-Id'. We highly recommend to always pass a (preferably unique) request ID, and include it into your client application logs whenever you make a request or receive a response (especially in the case of an error response). finAPI is also logging request IDs on its end. Having a request ID can help the finAPI support team to work more efficiently and solve tickets faster.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->createUser($user_create_params, $x_request_id);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {

### Parameters

Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
 **request_password_change_params** | [**\OpenAPIAccess\Client\Model\RequestPasswordChangeParams**](../Model/RequestPasswordChangeParams.md)|  |
 **x_request_id** | **string**| With any API call, you can pass a request ID. The request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters. Passing a longer string will result in an error. If you don&#39;t pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally. The request ID is always returned back in the response of a service, as a header with name &#39;X-Request-Id&#39;. We highly recommend to always pass a (preferably unique) request ID, and include it into your client application logs whenever you make a request or receive a response (especially in the case of an error response). finAPI is also logging request IDs on its end.

### Authorization

## `verifyUser()`

```php
verifyUser($user_id, $x_request_id)
```

Verify a user

Verify a user. User verification is only required when your client does not have auto-verification enabled (see field 'isUserAutoVerificationEnabled' in Client Configuration Resource). Must pass your global (i.e. client) access_token. Note that finAPI regards user identifiers case-insensitive.

### Example

```php
<?php
require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');


// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: finapi_auth
$config = OpenAPIAccess\Client\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');

// Configure OAuth2 access token for authorization: finapi_auth
$config = OpenAPIAccess\Client\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken('YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN');


$apiInstance = new OpenAPIAccess\Client\Api\UsersApi(
    // If you want use custom http client, pass your client which implements `GuzzleHttp\ClientInterface`.
    // This is optional, `GuzzleHttp\Client` will be used as default.
    new GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
$user_id = 'user_id_example'; // string | User's identifier
$x_request_id = 'x_request_id_example'; // string | With any API call, you can pass a request ID. The request ID can be an arbitrary string with up to 255 characters. Passing a longer string will result in an error. If you don't pass a request ID for a call, finAPI will generate a random ID internally.

try {
    $apiInstance->verifyUser($user_id, $x_request_id);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Exception when calling UsersApi->verifyUser: ', $e->getMessage(), PHP_EOL;
}
```

### Parameters
